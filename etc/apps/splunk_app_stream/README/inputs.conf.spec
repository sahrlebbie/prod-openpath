[upload_pcap://<name>]

pcap_file = <value>
* File path to the pcap file to be read and uploaded to Splunk for indexing

bitrate = <integer>
* Set a bitrate for how fast each pcap file is read
* By default, the bitrate is 10 Mbps if 'repeat' is enabled, otherwise it is unlimited (as fast as possible)

repeat = (true|false)
* Cause streamfwd to continuously repeat pcap files until it is terminated
* If this parameter is left blank, it will be defaulted to false

systemTime = (true|false)
* Use the system clock time for each packet read, instead of using the timestamps within pcap files
* If this parameter is left blank, it will be defaulted to use timestamps within pcap files
