================================================
Overview
================================================

This app provides a user-interface for editing lookup files in Splunk.



================================================
Configuring Splunk
================================================
Install this app into Splunk by doing the following:

  1. Log in to Splunk Web and navigate to "Apps » Manage Apps" via the app dropdown at the top left of Splunk's user interface
  2. Click the "install app from file" button
  3. Upload the file by clicking "Choose file" and selecting the app
  4. Click upload
  5. Restart Splunk if a dialog asks you to

Once the app is installed, you can use can open the "Lookup Editor" app from the main launcher.



================================================
Known Limitations
================================================

1) The lookup editor is limited to editing files up to 10 MB. Files larger than this cannot be edited because it consume too much memory on some browsers.

2) The lookup editor does not enforce concurrency with CSV files. This means that if two users edit a lookup file at the same time, someone will lose changes.
