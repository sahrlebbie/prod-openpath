<h4 style="width: 100%; color: #e7372f; margin: 0 auto; text-align: left; border-bottom: 2px solid #122840;">Technology Add-on Requirements</h4>

<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

<ul>
The Oracle Weblogic App for Splunk and the associated Technology Add-on (TA) is designed for installation in a Splunk Universal Forwarder on WebLogic (WLS) AdminServers. This TA polls your WLS AdminServers by the minute, hour, and daily for JMX data, and outputs the generated logging into monitored log files at /SPLUNK_HOME/var/log.
</ul>
<ul>
While the app itself inclusive of the TA is highly dynamic as well as independent to maximize on the native behavior and functionality within Weblogic as well as Splunk, Sideview Utils modules are used heavily within the dashboards of this app, thus the Sideview Utils app (Version 1.3.5) is required for all panels to display properly. At its core, the TA includes all the necessary technology to bridge the gap between these two technologies. 
</ul>
<ul>
Product documentation is widely available, though we highly recommend planning your deployment with a member of our Professional Services team. Please contact support@function1.com for more assistance.

<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

<ul>
Since this TA relies heavily on the interaction between a Splunk forwarder and WLS, the service accounts that run these applications will require access to each other’s file paths.  While both applications are often run by local system in a Windows environment, in a Unix environment these applications are more often run by separate service accounts.  In this event, the Splunk and Weblogic service accounts will require full access to each other’s respective application file paths.
</ul>
<ul>
The Oracle Weblogic App for Splunk Technology Addon (TA) is designed to be installed in a Splunk Universal Forwarder on WebLogic AdminServers.  This TA polls the OWLS AdminServer at by the minute, by the hour, and daily for JMX server and domain metrics, and outputs to the monitored file wls_jmx.log.
