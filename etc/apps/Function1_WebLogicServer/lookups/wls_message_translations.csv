013056, Error: Cannot translate from WLQL to EJB QL. It is suggested that you use the following EJB QL: FROM abstract-schema-name AS X. Usage of EJB QL of this form will result in a Finder with no WHERE clause.
013057, Error: \nProblem, in EJB QL the argument of OBJECT(field) in SELECT OBJECT(field) must be either a range variable identifier or a collection member identifier, either of which are defined in the query FROM clause as in 'SELECT OBJECT(e) FROM EmployeeBean AS e' or 'SELECT OBJECT(f) FROM EmployeeBean AS e, IN(e.friends)f'. 'field' is neither a range variable nor a collection member identifier. \n\nAction, review the EJB QL query and correct the SELECT clause.
013058, Error: In EJB QL, the argument of OBJECT(field) in SELECT OBJECT(field) must be a Range Variable that is mapped to an Abstract Schema Name ( EJBean ) that is declared in the FROM clause of the EJB QL Query. Found OBJECT argument 'field', which appears to be a cmp-field and not a Range Variable.
013059, Error: \nProblem, in EJB QL, the argument of OBJECT(field) 'field' must be an identifier that is declared as either a range variable identifier or a collection member identifier in the FROM clause of the query. 'field' is a path expression terminating in a cmp-field. It is not an identifier declared in the FROM clause. \n\nAction, rewrite the query paying attention to the SELECT clause.
013060, Error: \nProblem, in EJB QL in the clause SELECT field, 'field' was expected to be a single_valued_path_expression. The single_valued_path_expression must consist of at least 2 elements separated by periods. 'field' contains only one element. \n\nAction, rewrite the SELECT clause of the query. See EJB2.0 Specification for more details.
013061, Error: \nNote, in EJB QL, the argument of SELECT single_valued_path_expression cannot be an identification_variable. \n\t The compiler will assume that you meant to write the SELECT clause as SELECT OBJECT(field).
013062, Error: Sub-queries can only SELECT beans that have simple, non-compound Primary Keys. The bean specified by 'id' apparently has a compound key.
013063, Error: Left-hand argument to [NOT] MEMBER OF: 'Lhs' is a participant in a Many-To-Many Relationship. Left-hand argument to [NOT] MEMBER OF can only be single valued navigations. See the EJB 2.0 Final Spec '11.2.7.12 Collection Member Expressions'.
013064, Error: Cannot reliably generate a query that contains a NOT MEMBER OF clause, when the target of the query SELECT clause is not a subset of or equal to the left-hand side of NOT MEMBER OF: 'Lhs' and when the left-hand side of NOT MEMBER OF: 'Lhs' is not a subset of or equal to the SELECT clause target. One must be the subset of or equal to the other.
013065, Error: \nProblem, cannot perform Outer Join. Outer Join generation requires specification of a target database by including a database-type tag with the target database name in the weblogic-cmp-rdbms-jar.xml Deployment Descriptor file. \n\nAction, specify the target database by adding a database-type tag to the weblogic-cmp-rdbms-jar.xml Deployment Descriptor file.
013066, Error: Cannot do Outer Join between Bean: 'bean1' and Bean: 'bean2' for Database 'database'. No database support for SQL Outer Join.

280097, Warning: A file store failed to open file "fileName" in the Direct-Write read-buffered/write-unbuffered mode and is instead opening the file in a purely unbuffered mode. This may significantly lower the performance of stores with high read request activity. To fix this problem, configure a different synchronous write policy or, if using the Direct-Write policy, force the store into read-write-buffered mode using the AvoidDirectIO command line property documented in the store chapter of the Performance and Tuning guide.

280099, Warning:
280100, Warning:
280101, Warning: The persistent file store "storeName" is forced to use buffered I/O and so may have significantly degraded performance. Either the OS/hardware environment does not support the chosen write policy or the native wlfileio library is missing. See store open log messages for the requested and final write policies. See the documentation on store synchronous write policy configuration for advice.
280102, Warning: The perisistent file store "storeName" must reinitialize its cache: recovery may take longer than usual. The signature in the cache file "file" for the persistent store file "storeName" could not be verified, or the cache file is missing. Ignore this Warning if this is the first time the store has ever booted. Possible causes include: first boot of store (potentially after using a write policy different from Direct-Write-With-Cache), store migration, unclean shutdown, off-line store compression, and manual removal of cache files.
280103, Info: The persistent file store "store" will cache in cache.
280104, Warning: The persistent file store "store" will use buffered writes instead of direct IO because the configured block size "blockSize" is not a multiple of the environment's direct IO alignment "alignment". This may significantly reduce file store performance.
280105, Error: The persistent file store "store" cannot open file file.
280106, Error: The persistent file store "store" cannot memory-map the locked file "file" and has to downgrade to explicit buffered IO. For example, in some NFS environments memory-mapping and locking are not compatible. Consider configuring a local cache directory.

2000227, Dynamic: An error occurred while parsing the query filter "{1}". Error message: {0}
2000228, Dynamic: Subqueries are not supported for queries that execute in-memory. If you do not intend for this query to execute in-memory, consider setting IgnoreCache to true for the query.
2000229, Dynamic: The evaluation of the ordering expression of this query produced non-comparable values "{0}" and "{1}". Please check that the ordering clause is valid.
2000230, Dynamic: Filter invalid. Cannot compare {0} to {1}. Numeric comparisons must be between numeric types only. To enable such comparisons for backwards-compatibility, add "QuotedNumbersInQueries=true" to the org.apache.openjpa.Compatibility setting in your configuration.
2000231, Dynamic: If you use an aggregate function in a query filter, you must make sure to only invoke the aggregate on collections.
2000232, Dynamic: Cannot determine the type of field "{0}".
2000233, Dynamic: The variable "{0}" was found where a constant or field value was expected.
2000234, Dynamic: No "from" clause in expression.

2000252, Dynamic: An alias is required for the schema name "{0}" in the expression.
2000253, Dynamic: The JPQL statement is not valid: encountered a node of type "{0}".
2000254, Dynamic: The name "{0}" is not a recognized entity or identifier.
2000255, Dynamic: Undeclared identifier "{0}".
2000256, Dynamic: Expression "{0}" requires at least one child.
2000257, Dynamic: JPQL does not support declared parameters.
2000258, Dynamic: Encountered "{0}" at character {1}, but expected: {2}.
2000259, Dynamic: Update expression "{0}" may only use literals or parameters as update values.
2000260, Dynamic: A savepoint with the name "{0}" already exists. Each savepoint name must be unique.
2000261, Dynamic: Attempt to construct a query from an extent or class. You must pass a (possibly null) query string or template to the query factory method when creating the query.
2000262, Dynamic: Executing query: [{0}] with parameters: {1}
2000263, Dynamic: Unable to execute a query on type "{0}". This class or interface is not mapped, and does not have any mapped implementors.
2000264, Dynamic: Some of the object ids passed to getObjectsById were null.
2000265, Dynamic: Cannot perform find using null object id.
2000266, Dynamic: Encountered unmanaged object "{0}" in persistent field "{1}" of managed object "{2}" during flush. However, this field does not allow cascade persist. You cannot flush unmanaged objects.
2000267, Dynamic: The file named "{0}" could not be found.
2000268, Dynamic: Parameter "{0}" was declared with a primtive type, but has been given a null value.
2000269, Dynamic: Could not invoke the static getInstance method on the named factory class "{0}".
2000270, Dynamic: To perform writes on persistent data outside of a transaction, the "NontransactionalWrite" property must be set to true.
2000271, Dynamic: The instance "{0}" has an unknown state manager which prevents field inspection.
2000272, Dynamic: The type "{0}" as used in the parameter declarations could not be found in the imports.
2000273, Dynamic: Detected attempt to modify field "{0}" with value strategy "restrict".
2000274, Dynamic: Query hint value "{0}" ({1}) cannot be converted into an aggregate listener.
2000275, Dynamic: Bulk update queries when executed in memory may only change the value of primitives and simple Object fields.
2000276, Dynamic: This broker is not configured to use managed transactions.
2000277, Dynamic: The factory has been closed. The stack trace at which the factory was closed is held in the embedded exception.
2000278, Dynamic: There was an error packing the projection and/or aggregate results of the query into result type "{0}". See the nested throwable for details.
2000279, Dynamic: The parameter name or position "{0}" passed to execute() is not valid. All map keys must be a declared parameter name or a number matching the parameter position.
2000280, Dynamic: This operation failed for some instances. See the nested exceptions array for details.
2000281, Dynamic: Attempt to change a primary key field of an instance that already has a final object id. Only new, unflushed instances whose id you have not retrieved can have their primary keys changed.
2000282, Dynamic: OpenJPA cannot provide the initial value for field "{0}" because the field was never loaded before being changed.
2000283, Dynamic: Attempted to attach deleted instance type "{0}" with oid "{1}". If the instance is new, the version field should be left to its default value.
2000284, Dynamic: Cannot convert object "{0}" of type "{1}" into an instance of "{2}".
2000285, Dynamic: The specified type "{0}" could not be loaded. Please ensure that the class exists in the project class path.
2000286, Dynamic: Attempt to set an embedded value for unembeddable field "{0}". Please report this error to OpenJPA support.
2000287, Dynamic: Attempt to persist detached object "{0}".
2000288, Dynamic: Queries of this type ("{0}") cannot be executed in-memory. Either set IgnoreCache to true, set the org.apache.openjpa.FlushBeforeQueries property to true, or execute the query before changing any instances in the transaction.
2000289, Dynamic: Attempt to cast instance "{0}" to PersistenceCapable failed. Ensure that it has been enhanced.
2000290, Dynamic: The class "{0}" does not declare the "detachable" metadata extension, so cannot be detached.
2000291, Dynamic: You are attempting to access an embedded object reference that was obtained before the last transaction status change. After transactions begin and end, all references to embedded objects become invalid; you have to re-acquire the reference from the owning persistent object.
2000292, Dynamic: Cannot create an instance of "{0}": abstract classes and interfaces are not yet supported.
2000293, Dynamic: This operation is illegal when called during transaction completion.
2000294, Dynamic: The query cannot be executed because it has no valid expressions.
2000295, Dynamic: You cannot make a property access object created with "new" nontransactional.
2000296, Dynamic: Method "{0}" named in the org.apache.openjpa.MethodQL query must be static.
2000297, Dynamic: You are attempting to directly mutate a persistent second class object (such as a collection or map field) that you obtained before the transaction began. After beginning a datastore transaction, you must re-obtain any references to mutable second class objects from the owning persistent object. Detected attmpt to mutate value of field "{0}" in instance "{1}". This instance may not be locked correctly.
2000298, Dynamic: The given value "{0}" cannot be converted into an identity for "{2}". The value is the wrong type ({1}).
2000299, Dynamic: To perform this operation, you must be withing a transaction, or your settings must allow nontransactional writes and must not detach all nontransactional reads.
2000300, Dynamic: An error occured processing callbacks for instance of type "{0}".
2000301, Dynamic: An exception occurred while ending the transaction. This exception will be re-thrown.
2000302, Dynamic: Detected reentrant flush. Make sure your flush-time instance callback methods or event listeners do not invoke any operations that require the in-progress flush to complete.
2000303, Dynamic: This query on candidate type "{0}" with filter "{1}" involves combining the results of multiple queries in memory. You have chosen to order the results on "{2}", but you have not selected this data in your setResult() clause. Please include this ordering data in setResult() so that OpenJPA can extract it for in-memory ordering.
2000304, Dynamic: This lock manager does not recognize lock level "{0}".
2000305, Dynamic: Queries that have been serialized do not support this operation.
2000306, Dynamic: Attempt to initialize a state manager with a null persistence-capable instance for type "{0}". This is often caused by attempting to load an instance of an abstract class, or neglecting to use a class indicator when the base persistence-capable class in an inheritance tree is abstract.
2000307, Dynamic: More parameters were passed to execute() than were declared: {1} parameters were specified for query execution, but only {0} parameters were declared in the query.
2000308, Dynamic: Encountered unknown dependent instance "{0}". This error is often caused by either removing a dependent instance from one dependent field, but not other dependent fields that reference it, or by removing a dependent instance from its owning field, flushing (causing the unreferenced dependent instance to be deleted), and then trying to assign the deleted instance to another field before commit. The instance cannot be un-deleted, resulting in an error. Make sure not to leave dangling dependent references to objects, and to reassign dependent objects before flush so that OpenJPA does not think they are unreferenced and therefore safe to delete.
2000309, Dynamic: There was an error creating an instance of type "{0}" when packing the projection and/or aggregate results of the query. Ensure that you have defined a public no-args constructor in "{0}".
2000310, Dynamic: This query on type "{0}" must load the entire candidate class extent and evaluate the query in-memory. This may be very slow. The query must be executed in memory because OpenJPA is configured with IgnoreCache=false and FlushBeforeQueries=false and there are dirty instances that may affect the query''s outcome in the cache.
2000311, Dynamic: The context has been closed. The stack trace at which the context was closed is held in the embedded exception.
2000312, Dynamic: Released lock "{0}".
2000313, Dynamic: A candidate Class must be specified before executing a query.
2000314, Dynamic: Queries with aggregates or projections using variables currently cannot be executed in-memory. Either set IgnoreCache to true, set the org.apache.openjpa.FlushBeforeQueries property to true, or execute the query before changing any instances in the transaction. The offending query was on type "{0}" with filter "{1}".
2000315, Dynamic: Attempt to add null/empty field name to fetch configuration.
2000316, Dynamic: A query that declares unique results cannot be used to perform bulk updates.
2000317, Dynamic: The RestoreValues option is off, so initial values are not available. Turn on RestoreValues to be able to obtain initial values.
2000318, Dynamic: This query on candidate type "{0}" with filter "{1}" involves combining the results of multiple sub-queries. However, because this query is for aggregate data, OpenJPA cannot combine the sub-query aggregates into correct final values.
2000319, Dynamic: Could not invoke the static newInstance method on the named factory class "{0}".
2000320, Dynamic: You have modified the object id field of "{2}". Its old value was "{0}", and its new value is "{1}". Object id fields are immutable once the object id of the instance has been assigned.
2000321, Dynamic: This operation cannot be performed while a Transaction is active.
2000322, Dynamic: Attempt to initialize a state manager with an instance that is already managed ("{0}"). You might be trying to persist this instance in two threads at the same time.
2000323, Dynamic: Method "{0}(StoreContext, ClassMetaData, boolean, Map, FetchConfiguration)" is not declared in type "{1}". Check the method name supplied in your org.apache.openjpa.MethodQL query filter. OpenJPA is attempting to execute this query against the datastore; if you implemented the in-memory method instead (a method with the same signature but with an Object argument) and want this query to execute in-memory, supplly a Collection of candidates to filter.
2000324, Dynamic: Attempt to add null/empty fetch group name to fetch configuration.
2000325, Dynamic: Illegal operation attempted on a newly persisted instance: new objects cannot be evicted or made transient or non-transactional.
2000326, Dynamic: You must set the query filter to the name of the method to execute for this org.apache.openjpa.MethodQL query instance.
2000327, Dynamic: A query that declares a result range cannot be used to perform bulk updates.
2000328, Dynamic: The query on candidate type "{0}" with filter "{1}" was configured to have a unique result, but more than one instance matched the query.
2000329, Dynamic: The RestoreValues option is not set to "all", initial values of mutable fields are not available. Set RestoreValues to "all" in your properties to be able to obtain initial mutable values.
2000330, Dynamic: Invoking the setter for hint key "{0}" on "{1}" with value "{2}" caused an error.
2000331, Dynamic: Cannot access the detached object id of class "{0}". Ensure that the class has the "detachable" metadata extension, and the class has been re-enhanced.
2000332, Dynamic: The field "{0}" of instance "{1}" contained a null value; the metadata for this field specifies that nulls are illegal.
2000333, Dynamic: Cannot instantiate abstract class of type "{0}" with object id "{1}"; this may indicate that the inheritance discriminator for the class is not configured correctly.
2000334, Dynamic: A query that declares a result class cannot be used to perform bulk updates.
2000335, Dynamic: The instance "{0}" is managed by another context and cannot be inspected for field values.
2000336, Dynamic: The object "{0}" with id "{1}" has been deleted and cannot be attached.
2000337, Dynamic: Attempt to assign id "{0}" to new instance "{1}" failed; there is already an object in the L1 cache with this id. You must delete this object (in a previous transaction or the current one) before reusing its id. This error can also occur when a horizontally or vertically mapped classes uses auto-increment application identity and does not use a hierarchy of application identity classes.
2000338, Dynamic: Attempted to attach instance "{0}" of type "{1}", but this instance is already in the datastore as type "{2}".
2000339, Dynamic: Attempt to modify a read-only query object.
2000340, Dynamic: Operation attempted on a deleted instance.
2000341, Dynamic: You cannot perform operation {0} on detached object "{1}". This operation only applies to managed objects.
2000342, Dynamic: Acquired an exclusive lock on oid "{0}": "{1}".
2000343, Dynamic: A NamingException was thrown while obtaining the factory at "{0}" from JNDI.
2000344, Dynamic: You cannot use the modulo operator (%) on numbers of type BigDecimal.
2000345, Dynamic: You cannot refresh an instance that has been flushed to the data store.
2000346, Dynamic: Unable to copy field "{0}" for savepoint.
2000347, Dynamic: An inverse inconsistency in the object model was detected while flushing the field "{0}" of the instance with id "{1}" in context "{2}".
2000348, Dynamic: The transaction has been rolled back. See the nested exceptions for details on the errors that occurred.
2000349, Dynamic: Encountered deleted object "{0}" in persistent field "{1}" of managed object "{2}" during flush.
2000350, Dynamic: Query projections cannot include array, collection, or map fields. Invalid query: "{0}"
2000351, Dynamic: Query hint value "{0}" ({1}) cannot be converted into a filter listener.
2000352, Dynamic: Attempt to access an unloaded field of detached instance "{0}".
2000353, Dynamic: Cannot manipulate identity of type "{0}": it''s identity type is unknown.
2000354, Dynamic: You cannot assign managed object "{0}" to the primary key field of "{1}". Embedded primary key values must be transient objects.
2000355, Dynamic: Method "{0}(StoreContext, ClassMetaData, boolean, Object, Map, FetchConfiguration)" is not declared in type "{1}". Check the method name supplied in your MethodQL query filter. OpenJPA is attempting to execute this query in-memory; if you implemented the datastore method instead (a method with the same signature but without the Object argument) and want this query to execute in the datastore, either make the query before modifying objects in the current transaction, set IgnoreCache to true, or set the openjpa.FlushBeforeQueries property to true.
2000356, Dynamic: The "{0}" transaction property cannot be set during an active transaction.
2000357, Dynamic: This savepoint has already been initialized.
2000358, Dynamic: The named BrokerFactory "{0}" is not valid.
2000359, Dynamic: The given instance "{0}" is not managed by this context.
2000360, Dynamic: Attempt to commit a null javax.transaction.Transaction. Some application servers set the transaction to null if a rollback occurs.
2000361, Dynamic: Cannot load object with id "{0}". Instance "{1}" with the same id already exists in the L1 cache. This can occur when you assign an existing id to a new instance, and before flushing attempt to load the existing instance for that id.
2000362, Dynamic: Result type "{0}" does not have any public fields or setter methods for the projection or aggregate result element "{1}", nor does it have a generic put(Object,Object) method that can be used, nor does it have a public constructor that takes the types {2}.
2000363, Dynamic: Invoking the getter for hint key "{0}" on "{1}" caused an error.
2000364, Dynamic: There was an error when invoking the static newInstance method on the named factory class "{0}". See the nested exception for details.
2000365, Dynamic: The range of the query is too big. Start index: "{0}", end index: "{1}". The range must be less than Integer.MAX_VALUE.
2000366, Dynamic: There was an error invoking method "{0}" with arguments "{1}".
2000367, Dynamic: "{0}" is not the index of any managed field in "{1}".
2000368, Dynamic: This datastore does not support optimistic transactions. Set the Optimistic property to false.
2000369, Dynamic: The query range from {0} to {1} is not valid.
2000370, Dynamic: Can only perform operation while a transaction is active.
2000371, Dynamic: You have not set a savepoint with the name "{0}"
2000372, Dynamic: Illegal operation attempted on a dirty instance: dirty objects cannot be evicted or made transient or non-transactional.
2000373, Dynamic: Cannot create new application identity instance for abstract class "{0}".
2000374, Dynamic: Illegal operation attempted on a transient instance.
2000375, Dynamic: There was an error when invoking the static getInstance method on the named factory class "{0}". See the nested exception for details.
2000376, Dynamic: This data store does not support nontransactional reads. Set the NontransactionalRead property to false.
2000377, Dynamic: Starting OpenJPA {0}
2000378, Dynamic: The "{0}" query type does not support this operation.
2000379, Dynamic: Properties: {0}
2000380, Dynamic: To perform reads on persistent data outside of a transaction, the "NontransactionalRead" property must be set on the Transaction.
2000381, Dynamic: Encountered new object "{0}" in persistent field "{1}" of managed object "{2}" during attach. However, this field does not allow cascade attach. You cannot attach a reference to a new object without cascading.
2000382, Dynamic: This data store cannot return connections.
2000383, Dynamic: Encountered object "{0}" without a version field during attach. In order to attach an object, it must either be enhanced or must have a version field.
2000384, Dynamic: Field "{0}" is not declared in "{1}", or is not managed.
2000385, Dynamic: The transaction cannot be committed, because it was already marked for rollback only. The transaction will be rolled back instead.
2000386, Dynamic: You did not name the factory class with the required property org.apache.openjpa.BrokerFactory.
2000387, Dynamic: Cannot execute query; some declared parameters were not given values. You must supply a value for each of the following parameters, in the given order: {0}
2000388, Dynamic: The configured SavepointManager does not support incremental flushing when a savepoint has been set. You must release your savepoints before flushing.
2000389, Dynamic: Cannot rollback/release last savepoint as no savepoint has been set.
2000390, Dynamic: The {1} declaration "{0}" is not valid. Variables and imports must be delimited with ";". Parameters and orderings must be delimited with ",". Imports require the "import" keyword, and orderings require the "ascending" or "descending" keyword.
2000391, Dynamic: There is no conversion between query projection type "{0}" and result type "{1}".
2000392, Dynamic: Attempt to copy field "{0}" failed. The field is not copyable. This can occur with custom SCO types or with large result set fields. Only standard or immutable SCO types can be attached and detached.
2000393, Dynamic: Cannot execute query; the declared parameter "{0}" was not given a value.
2000394, Dynamic: An object of type "{0}" with oid "{1}" already exists in this context; another cannot be persisted.
2000395, Dynamic: The instance of type "{0}" with oid "{1}" no longer exists in the data store. This may mean that you deleted the instance in a separate transaction, but this context still has a cached version.
2000396, Dynamic: The type "{0}" declares datastore identity but the value passed to lookup of type "{1}" is not a OpenJPA id instance.
2000397, Dynamic: You set the method name of this openjpa.MethodQL query to "{1}", but class "{0}" is not a valid class name. Make sure to fully qualify the class name or to import its package into this query if the class is not in the query candidate class'' package.
2000398, Dynamic: Executing query: {0}
2000399, Dynamic: This data store does not support incremental flushing. If you got this error while performing a query, make sure that you have not set the FlushBeforeQueries option to true, either by setting that option in your configuration file, or by programmatically setting the current FetchConfiguration''s FlushBeforeQueries property to QueryFlushModes.FLUSH_TRUE.
2000400, Dynamic: Type "{0}" and its persistent superclass "{1}" declare different access types. All persistent classes in an inheritance hierarchy must use the same access type (field vs. property access).
2000401, Dynamic: Concrete type "{0}" with application identity does not declare any primary key fields.
2000402, Dynamic: A potentially serious error occurred while processing registered class "{0}". Deferring processing of this class until next opportunity.
2000403, Dynamic: The metadata for some of the following classes may not have been dropped: {0}
2000404, Dynamic: Field "{0}" is not a type that is persistent by default. If you want this field to be persistent, you have to explicitly set it to persistent in your metadata.
2000405, Dynamic: Array fields do not support large result sets. Remove the "lrs" extension from field "{0}".
2000406, Dynamic: Generating default metadata for type "{0}".
2000407, Dynamic: Type "{0}" is an interface and therefore cannot be made persistent.
2000408, Dynamic: There was an error invoking the factory for field "{0}" on datastore value "{1}": {2}
2000409, Dynamic: Field "{0}" is named as the detach state field in type "{1}", but is a managed field. Detach state fields cannot be managed.
2000410, Dynamic: Attempt to add an unnamed fetch group to "{0}".
2000411, Dynamic: "{0}" declares a read only value of "{1}". This is not a recognized strategy. Available strategies are: {2}
2000412, Dynamic: The identity class specified by type "{0}" is not valid, as the hashCode method is not overridden. Implement hashCode so that two instances with the same primary key values have the same hash code.
2000413, Dynamic: The extension key "{1}" for "{0}" is not recognized and will be ignored, although the name closely matches the valid key "{3}". Valid extension keys are "{2}".
2000414, Dynamic: Could not locate metadata for the class using alias "{0}". Registered alias mappings: "{1}"
2000415, Dynamic: Attempt to include non-existent fetch group "{1}" in fetch group "{0}".
2000416, Dynamic: The map value type of field "{0}" a derived key must be a persistent class with exactly one primary key field.
2000417, Dynamic: Your configured MetaDataIO cannot create metadata. You must create it by hand.
2000418, Dynamic: Metadata tool running on type "{0}" with action "{1}".
2000419, Dynamic: The class name "{0}" used in a metadata extension on field "{1}" is not valid.
2000420, Dynamic: The class "{0}" listed in the openjpa.MetaDataFactory configuration property could not be loaded; ignoring.
2000421, Dynamic: Type "{0}" with application identity and no superclass does not declare an id class. This type is not eligible for builtin identity, so it must declare an id class.

2002337, Dynamic: This database dictionary does not support auto-assigned column values.
2002338, Dynamic: The database "{0}" does not support the indexOf function.
2002339, Dynamic: Informix cannot perform FOR UPDATE selects on multiple tables, or when it is a SELECT DISTINCT. The tables used in this select are: "{0}". You should either configure your application to avoid multi-table/distinct selects, use optimistic locking, or set the "SimulateLocking" DBDictionary property to allow non-locking selects within pessimistic transactions.
2002340, Dynamic: Foreign key "{0}" on table "{1}" references a table ("{2}") that was not found.
2002341, Dynamic: LOB operations not allowed for batched statement: {0}
2002342, Dynamic: The database dictionary in use ("{0}") reports that it does not have feature "{1}". This feature is needed to complete the current operation. To force OpenJPA to try to use the feature anyway, set the following property: org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary: {1}=
2002343, Dynamic: Oracle 8 does not support SQL92 syntax. You can avoid this message by setting the "JoinSyntax" DBDictionary property to "database".For example: org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary: oracle(JoinSyntax=database)
2002344, Dynamic: Could not find an OracleConnection instance from this connection class "{0}".
2002345, Dynamic: The Microsoft JDBC driver has bugs that manifest themselves when prepared statements are pooled. Please disable prepared statement pooling when using the Microsoft JDBC driver by including "MaxCachedStatements=0" in your org.apache.openjpa.ConnectionFactoryProperties configuration property.
2002346, Dynamic: Cannot outer join tables "{0}" and "{1}" using native join syntax and constant joins. If you are using Oracle 9 or higher, you should instead use SQL92 joins by specifying the JoinSyntax value in the org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary configuration property: org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary: oracle(JoinSyntax=sql92).
2002347, Dynamic: The Oracle 9.2 JDBC driver has problems with batch statements and has been disabled by default. You can enable batched statements by setting the "BatchLimit" DBDictionary property. You may be able to bypass this problem by disabling prepared statement pooling. The compatible 9.0.1 driver does not have this behavior.
2002348, Dynamic: The BatchLimit property was set even though the Oracle 9.2 driver may not support this behavior correctly. If you see a number of invalid update count errors, you should disable statement batching by setting the BatchLimit property to 0.
2002349, Dynamic: Could not outer join the given foreign key "{0}" due to syntax and foreign key limitations. The join was converted to an inner join.
2002350, Dynamic: You are using NCHAR or NCLOB columns with a data source or driver that doesn't implement OraclePreparedStatement.setFormOfUse(). Storing unicode values may fail or be corrupted.

2002358, Dynamic: Aborting UNION: cannot select placeholder for non-column select SQL.
2002359, Dynamic: This database dictionary "{0}" is not officially supported by Oracle.
2002360, Dynamic: OpenJPA is now connecting to the database in order to figure out what JDBC driver you are using, as OpenJPA must alter its behavior for this database depending on the driver vendor. To avoid this connection, set the DriverVendor value in your org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary configuration property to one of the following values: oracle, oracle92 (for the 9.2 driver), datadirect, datadirect61 (for driver versions <= 3.1), other For example: org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary: oracle(DriverVendor=oracle92)
2002361, Dynamic: The JNetDirect JDBC driver has problems when using batch statements. Please disable prepared statement pooling when using the this JDBC driver by including "BatchLimit=0" in your org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary configuration property.
2002362, Dynamic: Aborting UNION: incompatible ordering columns/sql or direction.

2002365, Dynamic: They Sybase connection URL "{0}" may be invalid: it does not contain the parameter "BE_AS_JDBC_COMPLIANT_AS_POSSIBLE=true", which is required for the Sybase JConnect driver to behave in a JDBC-compliant way.
2002366, Dynamic: Aborting UNION: different numbers of order-by criteria in selects.
2002367, Dynamic: The last generated key query did not return any results.
2002368, Dynamic: DB2 cannot perform FOR UPDATE selects on multiple tables. The tables used in this select are: "{0}". You should either configure your application to avoid multi-table selects, use optimistic locking, or set the "SimulateLocking" DBDictionary property to allow non-locking selects within pessimistic transactions.
2002369, Dynamic: Your database configuration was not recognized as a supported OpenJPA database. The generic dictionary will be used, which may result in limited functionality. This behavior can be overridden by specifying the appropriate dictionary class in the "org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary" property of the OpenJPA configuration.
2002370, Dynamic: {0}.{1}() is illegal to be invoked
2002371, Dynamic: The column "{0}" was marked as being auto-assigned, but the server reported that the assigned value was null.
2002372, Dynamic: You are using CHAR columns with a data source or driver that doesn't implement OraclePreparedStatement.setFixedCHAR(). Comparisons on unpadded string values may fail.
2002373, Dynamic: This version of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver does not support the Statement.setFetchSize() method. OpenJPA will no longer attempt to set the statement fetch size. To suppress this warning, ensure that the org.apache.openjpa.FetchBatchSize configuration property is set to zero. The original PostgreSQL driver exception is being logged for your reference.
2002374, Dynamic: supplied array of result object providers is null
2002375, Dynamic: An error occurred when attempting to set an Oracle savepoint "{0}". You must use Oracle driver and database 9.2 or higher.

2002377, Dynamic: supplied result set is null
2002378, Dynamic: The SQLServer connection URL "{0}" may be invalid: it does not contain the parameter "SelectMethod=cursor", which is necessary for the driver to properly support large result sets.
2002379, Dynamic: The database "{0}" does not support the substring function.
2002380, Dynamic: This query cannot be completed. The SQL SELECTs needed to complete the query have incompatible ordering. Their results cannot be merged.
