220505,"WebLogic JAX-WS web service clients are assigned a unique identity that is intended to represent the business purpose of that client. This identity can be specified directly using weblogic.jws.jaxws.client.ClientIdentityFeature or it can be allowed to be implicit. Implicit identity is generated automatically based on environmental information at the point where a Port/Dispatch instance is created. Your code has received an implicit client identity that is getting used (again implicitly) across multiple services or sets of features. All statistics gathered for a given client instance are rolled up under the client instances client identity. If client instances using different services and/or feature sets contribute statistics to the same client identity, this can be confusing. It is even possible for clients to behave incorrectly when more advanced web service features are used.","Best practice is to create a specific client identity (with a name representing a logical business purpose) for the client and denote this identity by passing weblogic.jws.jaxws.client.ClientIdentityFeature to the call to Service.getPort/createDispatch. Further, it is recommended that you pass a single/global set of web service feature objects to that call (e.g. Create WebServiceFeature instances as static class members or in a method annotated with @PostConstruct for containers compatible with this annotation). The actual call to Service.getPort()/createDispatch() should still be made in any way that makes sense for your uses (e.g. calling getPort on demand in a web service method, with Service created as a static class member)."
