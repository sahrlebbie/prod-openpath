Employing numerous tactics and techniques, these attacks continue to escalate in complexity. <br></br>There is a wide range of motivations for these state-sponsored hacks, including stealing valuable corporate, military, or diplomatic data&#1151;all of which could confer advantages in various arenas. They may also target critical infrastructure. <br></br>One joint Technical Alert (TA) issued by the Department of Homeland and the FBI in mid-March of 2018 attributed some cyber activity targeting utility infrastructure to operatives sponsored by the Russian government. The hackers executed spearfishing attacks, installed malware, employed watering-hole domains, and more. While they caused no physical damage, the attacks provoked fears that a nation-state could turn off water, redirect power, or compromise a nuclear power plant.<br></br>Suspicious activities--spikes in SMB traffic, processes that launch netsh (to modify the network configuration), suspicious registry modifications, and many more--may all be events you may wish to investigate further. While the use of these technique may be an indication that a nation-state actor is attempting to compromise your environment, it is important to note that these techniques are often employed by other groups, as well.",

            "narrative": "This Analytic Story looks for probing and exploitation attempts targeting JBoss application servers. While the vulnerabilities associated with this story are rather dated, they were leveraged in a spring 2016 campaign in connection with the Samsam ransomware variant. Incidents involving this ransomware are unique, in that they begin with attacks against vulnerable services, rather than the phishing or drive-by attacks more common with ransomware. In this case, vulnerable JBoss applications appear to be the target of choice.<br></br>It is helpful to understand how often a notable event generated by this story occurs, as well as the commonalities between some of these events, both of which may provide clues about whether this is a common occurrence of minimal concern or a rare event that may require more extensive investigation. It may also help to understand whether the issue is restricted to a single user/system or whether it is broader in scope.<br></br>When looking at the target of the behavior uncovered by the event, you should note the sensitivity of the user and or/system to help determine the potential impact. It is also helpful to identify other recent events involving the target. This can help tie different events together and give further situational awareness regarding the target host.<br></br>Various types of information for external systems should be reviewed and, potentially, collected if the incident is, indeed, judged to be malicious. This data may be useful for generating your own threat intelligence, so you can create future alerts.<br></br>The following factors may assist you in determining whether the event is malicious: <ul><li>Country of origin</li><li>Responsible party</li><li>Fully qualified domain names associated with the external IP address</li><li>Registration of fully qualified domain names associated with external IP address</li></ul> Determining whether it is a dynamic domain frequently visited by others and/or how third parties categorize it can also help you qualify and understand the event and possible motivation for the attack. In addition, there are various sources that may provide reputation information on the IP address or domain name, which can assist you in determining whether the event is malicious in nature. Finally, determining whether there are other events associated with the IP address may help connect data points or expose other historic events that might be brought back into scope.<br></br>Gathering various data on the system of interest can sometimes help quickly determine whether something suspicious is happening. Some of these items include determining who else may have logged into the system recently, whether any unusual scheduled tasks exist, whether the system is communicating on suspicious ports, whether there are modifications to sensitive registry keys, and/or whether there are any known vulnerabilities on the system. This information can often highlight other activity commonly seen in attack scenarios or give more information about how the system may have been targeted.<br></br>When a specific service or application is targeted, it is often helpful to know the associated version, to help determine whether it is vulnerable to a specific exploit.<br></br>If you suspect an attack targeting a web server, it is helpful to look at some of the behavior of the web service to see if there is evidence that the service has been compromised. Some indications of this might be network connections to external resources, the web service spawning child processes that are not associated with typical behavior, and whether the service wrote any files that might be malicious in nature.<br></br>If a suspicious file is found, we can review more information about it to help determine if it is, in fact, malicious. Identifying the file type, any processes that opened the file, the processes that may have created and/or modified the file, and how many other systems potentially have this file can you determine whether the file is malicious. Also, determining the file hash and checking it against reputation sources, such as VirusTotal, can sometimes help you quickly determine if it is malicious in nature.<br></br>Often, a simple inspection of a suspect process name and path can tell you if the system has been compromised. For example, if svchost.exe is found running from a location other than <code>C:\\Windows\\System32</code>, it is likely something malicious designed to hide in plain sight when simply reviewing process names. <br></br>It can also be helpful to examine various behaviors of and the parent of the process of interest. For example, if it turns out the process of interest is malicious, it would be good to see whether the parent process spawned other processes that might also warrant further scrutiny. If a process is suspect, a review of the network connections made around the time of the event and noting whether the process has spawned any child processes could be helpful in determining whether it is malicious or executing a malicious script.",

It is helpful to understand how often the notable events generated by this story occur, as well as the commonalities between some of these events. These factors may provide clues about whether this is a common occurrence of minimal concern or a rare event that may require more extensive investigation. Likewise, it is important to determine whether the issue is restricted to a single user/system or is broader in scope.<br/><br/>The following factors may assist you in determining whether the event is malicious: <ul><li>Country of origin</li><li>Responsible party</li><li>Fully qualified domain names associated with the external IP address</li><li>Registration of fully qualified domain names associated with external IP address</li></ul>Determining whether it is a dynamic domain frequently visited by others and/or how third parties categorize it can also help you answer some questions surrounding the attacker and details related to the external system. In addition, there are various sources--such as VirusTotal&#151; that can provide some reputation information on the IP address or domain name, which can assist in determining whether the event is malicious. Finally, determining whether there are other events associated with the IP address may help connect data points or show other events that should be brought into scope.<br/><br/>Gathering data on the system of interest can sometimes help you quickly determine whether something suspicious is happening. Some of these items include finding out who else may have recently logged into the system, whether any unusual scheduled tasks exist, whether the system is communicating on suspicious ports, whether there are modifications to sensitive registry keys, and whether there are any known vulnerabilities on the system. This information can often highlight other activity commonly seen in attack scenarios or give more information about how the system may have been targeted.<br/><br/>Often, a simple inspection of the process name and path can tell you if the system has been compromised. For example, if <code>svchost.exe</code> is found running from a location other than <code>C:\\Windows\\System32</code>, it is likely something malicious designed to hide in plain sight when cursorily reviewing process names. Similarly, if the process itself seems legitimate, but the parent process is running from the temporary browser cache, that could be indicative of activity initiated via a compromised website a user visited.<br/><br/>It can also be very helpful to examine various behaviors of the process of interest or the parent of the process of interest. For example, if it turns out the process of interest is malicious, it would be good to see if the parent to that process spawned other processes that might be worth further scrutiny. If a process is suspect, a review of the network connections made in and around the time of the event and/or whether the process spawned any child processes could be helpful, as well.<br/><br/>In the event a system is suspected of having been compromised via a malicious website, we suggest reviewing the browsing activity from that system around the time of the event.

            "narrative": "In March of 2017, a remote code-execution vulnerability in the Jakarta Multipart parser in Apache Struts, a widely used open-source framework for creating Java web applications, was disclosed and assigned to CVE-2017-5638. About two months later, hackers exploited the flaw to carry out the world's <a href=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/09/07/nations-biggest-hacks-and-data-breaches-millions/644311001/> 5th largest data breach</a>. The target, credit giant Equifax, <a href=https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/16/technology/equifax-breach-security-hole/index.html>told investigators</a> that it had become aware of the vulnerability two months before the attack. <br></br>The exploit involved manipulating the <code>Content-Type HTTP</code> header to execute commands embedded in the header.<br></br>This Analytic Story contains two different searches that help to identify activity that may be related to this issue. The first search looks for characteristics of the <code>Content-Type</code> header consistent with attempts to exploit the vulnerability. This should be a relatively pertinent indicator, as the <code>Content-Type</code> header is generally consistent and does not have a large degree of variation.<br></br>The second search looks for the execution of various commands typically entered on the command shell when an attacker first lands on a system. These commands are not generally executed on web servers during the course of day-to-day operation, but they may be used when the system is undergoing maintenance or troubleshooting.<br></br>First, it is helpful is to understand how often the notable event is generated, as well as the commonalities in some of these events. This may help determine whether this is a common occurrence that is of a lesser concern or a rare event that may require more extensive investigation. It can also help to understand whether the issue is restricted to a single user or system or is broader in scope.<br></br>When looking at the target of the behavior illustrated by the event, you should note the sensitivity of the user and or/system to help determine the potential impact. It is also helpful to see what other events involving the target have occurred in the recent past. This can help tie different events together and give further situational awareness regarding the target.<br></br>Various types of information for external systems should be reviewed and (potentially) collected if the incident is, indeed, judged to be malicious. Information like this can be useful in generating your own threat intelligence to create alerts in the future.<br></br>Looking at the country, responsible party, and fully qualified domain names associated with the external IP address--as well as the registration information associated with those domain names, if they are frequently visited by others--can help you answer the question of \"who,\" in regard to the external system. Answering that can help qualify the event and may serve useful for tracking. In addition, there are various sources that can provide some reputation information on the IP address or domain name, which can assist in determining if the event is malicious in nature. Finally, determining whether or not there are other events associated with the IP address may help connect some dots or show other events that should be brought into scope.<br></br>Gathering various data elements on the system of interest can sometimes help quickly determine that something suspicious may be happening. Some of these items include determining who else may have recently logged into the system, whether any unusual scheduled tasks exist, whether the system is communicating on suspicious ports, whether there are modifications to sensitive registry keys, and whether there are any known vulnerabilities on the system. This information can often highlight other activity commonly seen in attack scenarios or give more information about how the system may have been targeted.<br></br>When a specific service or application is targeted, it is often helpful to know the associated version to help determine whether or not it is vulnerable to a specific exploit.<br></br>When it is suspected there is an attack targeting a web server, it is helpful to look at some of the behavior of the web service to see if there is evidence that the service has been compromised. Some indications of this might be network connections to external resources, the web service spawning child processes that are not associated with typical behavior, and whether the service wrote any files that might be malicious in nature.<br></br>In the event that a suspicious file is found, we can review more information about it to help determine if it is, in fact, malicious. Identifying the file type, any processes that have the file open, what processes created and/or modified the file, and the number of systems that may have this file can help to determine if the file is malicious. Also, determining the file hash and checking it against reputation sources, such as VirusTotal, can sometimes quickly help determine whether it is malicious in nature.<br></br>Often, a simple inspection of a suspect process name and path can tell you if the system has been compromised. For example, if <code>svchost.exe</code> is found running from a location other than <code>C:\\Windows\\System32</code>, it is likely something malicious designed to hide in plain sight when simply reviewing process names. Similarly, if the process itself seems legitimate, but the parent process is running from the temporary browser cache, there may be activity initiated via a compromised website the user visited.<br></br>It can also be very helpful to examine various behaviors of the process of interest or the parent of the process that is of interest. For example, if it turns out that the process of interest is malicious, it would be good to see if the parent to that process spawned other processes that might also be worth further scrutiny. If a process is suspect, reviewing the network connections made around the time of the event and/or if the process spawned any child processes could be helpful in determining whether it is malicious or executing a malicious script.",

            "narrative": "Attackers use a variety of techniques to entice users to run malicious code or to persist on an endpoint. One way to accomplish these goals is to leverage file extensions and the mechanism Windows uses to associate files with specific applications. <br></br> Since its earliest days, Windows has used extensions to identify file types. Users have become familiar with these extensions and their application associations. For example, if users see that a file ends in <code>.doc</code> or <code>.docx</code>, they will assume that it is a Microsoft Word document and expect that double-clicking will open it using <code>winword.exe</code>. The user will typically also presume that the <code>.docx</code> file is safe. <br></br> Attackers take advantage of this expectation by obfuscating the true file extension. They can accomplish this in a couple of ways. One technique involves inserting multiple spaces in the file name before the extension to hide the extension from the GUI, obscuring the true nature of the file. Another approach involves prepending the real extension with a different one. This is especially effective when Windows is configured to \"hide extensions for known file types.\" In this case, the real extension is not displayed, but the prepended one is, leading end users to believe the file is a different type than it actually is.<br></br>Changing the association between a file extension and an application can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The technique typically involves changing the association for an often-launched file type to associate instead with a malicious program the attacker has dropped on the endpoint. When the end user launches a file that has been manipulated in this way, it will execute the attacker's malware. It will also execute the application the end user expected to run, cleverly obscuring the fact that something suspicious has occurred.<br></br>Run the searches in this story to detect and investigate suspicious behavior that may indicate abuse or manipulation of Windows file extensions and/or associations.",

Organizations must be extra vigilant in detecting lateral movement techniques and look for suspicious activity in and around high-value strategic network assets, such as Active Directory, which are often considered the primary target or \"crown jewels\" to a persistent threat actor.<br></br>An adversary can use lateral movement for multiple purposes, including remote execution of tools, pivoting to additional systems, obtaining access to specific information or files, access to additional credentials, exfiltrating data, or delivering a secondary effect. Adversaries may use legitimate credentials alongside inherent network and operating-system functionality to remotely connect to other systems and remain under the radar of network defenders.<br></br>If there is evidence of lateral movement, it is imperative for analysts to collect evidence of the associated offending hosts. For example, an attacker might leverage host A to gain access to host B. From there, the attacker may try to move laterally to host C. In this example, the analyst should gather as much information as possible from all three hosts. <br></br> It is also important to collect authentication logs for each host, to ensure that the offending accounts are well-documented. Analysts should account for all processes to ensure that the attackers did not install unauthorized software.",

This could inadvertently send users intending to visit google.com, for example, to an unrelated malicious website. Another technique involves using the DNS protocol for command-and-control activities with the attacker's malicious code or to covertly exfiltrate data.

In fact, research shows that as many as [91% of all successful attacks](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/91-percent-cyber-attacks-start-phishing-email-heres-how-protect-against-phishing) are initiated via a phishing email. <br></br>As most people know, these emails use fraudulent domains, [email scraping](https://www.cyberscoop.com/emotet-trojan-phishing-scraping-templates-cofense-geodo/), familiar contact names inserted as senders, and other tactics to lure targets into clicking a malicious link, opening an attachment with a [nefarious payload](https://www.cyberscoop.com/emotet-trojan-phishing-scraping-templates-cofense-geodo/), or entering sensitive personal information that perpetrators may intercept. This attack technique requires a relatively low level of skill and allows adversaries to easily cast a wide net. Worse, because its success relies on the gullibility of humans, it's impossible to completely \"automate\" it out of your environment. However, you can use ES and ESCU to detect and investigate potentially malicious payloads injected into your environment subsequent to a phishing attack. <br></br>While any kind of file may contain a malicious payload, some are more likely to be perceived as benign (and thus more often escape notice) by the average victim&#151;especially when the attacker sends an email that seems to be from one of their contacts. An example is Microsoft Office files. Most corporate users are familiar with documents with the following suffixes: .doc/.docx (MS Word), .xls/.xlsx (MS Excel), and .ppt/.pptx (MS PowerPoint), so they may click without a second thought, slashing a hole in their organizations' security. <br></br>Following is a typical series of events, according to an [article by Trend Micro](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/rising-trend-attackers-using-lnk-files-download-malware/):<ol><li>Attacker sends a phishing email. Recipient downloads the attached file, which is typically a .docx or .zip file with an embedded .lnk file</li><li>The .lnk file executes a PowerShell script</li><li>Powershell executes a reverse shell, rendering the exploit successful </ol>As a side note, adversaries are likely to use a tool like Empire to craft and obfuscate payloads and their post-injection activities, such as [exfiltration, lateral movement, and persistence](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire).<br></br>This Analytic Story focuses on detecting signs that a malicious payload has been injected into your environment. For example, one search detects outlook.exe writing a .zip file. Another looks for suspicious .lnk files launching processes.",

Attackers will often leverage Windows services for persistence, hiding in plain sight, seeking the ability to run privileged code that can interact with the kernel. In many cases, attackers will create a new service to host their malicious code. Attackers have also been observed modifying unnecessary or unused services to point to their own code, as opposed to what was intended. In these cases, attackers often use tools to create or modify services in ways that are not typical for most environments, providing opportunities for detection.",

One reason is its distributed nature. It relies on unstructured connections between millions of clients and servers over inherently insecure protocols.<br></br>The gravity and extent of the importance of securing DNS from attacks is undeniable. The fallout of compromised DNS can be disastrous. Not only can hackers bring down an entire business, they can intercept confidential information, emails, and login credentials, as well. <br></br>On January 22, 2019, the US Department of Homeland Security 2019's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) raised awareness of some high-profile DNS hijacking attacks against infrastructure, both in the United States and abroad. It issued Emergency Directive 19-01 (see https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/19-01/), which summarized the activity and required government agencies to take the following four actions, all within 10 days: <ol><li>For all .gov or other agency-managed domains, audit public DNS records on all authoritative and secondary DNS servers, verify that they resolve to the intended location or report them to CISA.</li><li>Update the passwords for all accounts on systems that can make changes to each agency 2019's DNS records.</li><li>Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts on systems that can make changes to each agency's 2019 DNS records or, if impossible, provide CISA with the names of systems, the reasons why MFA cannot be enabled within the required timeline, and an ETA for when it can be enabled.</li><li>CISA will begin regular delivery of newly added certificates to Certificate Transparency (CT) logs for agency domains via the Cyber Hygiene service. Upon receipt, agencies must immediately begin monitoring CT log data for certificates issued that they did not request. If an agency confirms that a certificate was unauthorized, it must report the certificate to the issuing certificate authority and to CISA.</li></ol>Of course, it makes sense to put equivalent actions in place within your environment, as well. <br></br>In DNS hijacking, the attacker assumes control over an account or makes use of a DNS service exploit to make changes to DNS records. Once they gain access, attackers can substitute their own MX records, name-server records, and addresses, redirecting emails and traffic through their infrastructure, where they can read, copy, or modify information seen. They can also generate valid encryption certificates to help them avoid browser-certificate checks. In one notable attack on the Internet service provider, GoDaddy, the hackers altered Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records a relatively minor change that did not inflict excessive damage but allowed for more effective spam campaigns.<br></br>The searches in this Analytic Story help you detect and investigate activities that may indicate that DNS hijacking has taken place within your environment.",

It employs a proxy template to allow a registered domain to impersonate targeted sites, such as Linkedin, Amazon, Okta, Github, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Office 365, and others.

As a result, the group's activity, which the US government refers to as \"Hidden Cobra,\" has surreptitiously crept onto the collective radar as a preeminent global threat.<br></br>These state-sponsored actors are thought to be responsible for everything from a hack on a South Korean nuclear plant to an attack on Sony in anticipation of its release of the movie \"The Interview\" at the end of 2014. They're also notorious for cyberespionage. In recent years, the group seems to be focused on financial crimes, such as cryptojacking.<br></br>In June of 2018, The Department of Homeland Security, together with the FBI and other U.S. government partners, issued Technical Alert (TA-18-149A) to advise the public about two variants of North Korean malware. One variant, dubbed \"Joanap,\" is a multi-stage peer-to-peer botnet that allows North Korean state actors to exfiltrate data, download and execute secondary payloads, and initialize proxy communications. The other variant, \"Brambul,\" is a Windows32 SMB worm that is dropped into a victim network. When executed, the malware attempts to spread laterally within a victim's local subnet, connecting via the SMB protocol and initiating brute-force password attacks. It reports details to the Hidden Cobra actors via email, so they can use the information for secondary remote operations.<br></br>Among other searches in this Analytic Story is a detection search that looks for the creation or deletion of hidden shares, such as, \"adnim$,\" which the Hidden Cobra malware creates on the target system. Another looks for the creation of three malicious files associated with the malware. You can also use a search in this story to investigate activity that indicates that malware is sending email back to the attackers.",

For example, in early 2018, Emotet was found to be using its loader function to spread the Quakbot and Ransomware variants. <br></br>According to the TA, the the malware continues to be among the most costly and destructive malware affecting the private and public sectors. Researchers have linked it to the threat group Mealybug, which has also been on the security communitys radar since 2014.<br></br>The searches in this Analytic Story will help you find executables that are rarely used in your environment, specific registry paths that malware often uses to ensure survivability and persistence, instances where cmd.exe is used to launch script interpreters, and other indicators that Emotet or other malware has compromised your environment.

This malware provides the attackers with remote access to the target system, decrypting and extracting a copy of its main DLL payload from its resource section. Before writing the payload to disk, it inserts a randomly generated string into the middle of the decrypted payload in an attempt to evade hash-based detections.<br></br>Awareness of the Orangeworm group first surfaced in January, 2015. It has conducted targeted attacks against related industries, as well, such as pharmaceuticals and healthcare IT solution providers.<br></br>Although the group's motivation is unknown, its goal may be stealing patient information to sell on the black market. Another possible explanation is corporate espionage. <br></br>Healthcare may be a promising target, because it is notoriously behind in technology, often using older operating systems and neglecting to patch computers. Even so, the group was able to evade detection for a full three years. Sources say that the malware spread quickly within the target networks, infecting computers used to control medical devices, such as MRI and X-ray machines.<br></br>This Analytic Story is designed to help you detect and investigate suspicious activities that may be indicative of an Orangeworm attack. One detection search looks for command-line arguments. Another monitors for uses of sc.exe, a non-essential Windows file that can manipulate Windows services.

While that point is debatable, it is true that attacks against MacOS systems are much less common. However, this fact does not mean that Macs are impervious to breaches. To the contrary, research has shown that that Mac malware is increasing at an alarming rate. According to AV-test, in 2018, there were 86,865 new MacOS malware variants, up from 27,338 the year before&#151;a 31% increase. In contrast, the independent research firm found that new Windows malware had increased from 65.17M to 76.86M during that same period, less than half the rate of growth. The bottom line is that while the numbers look a lot smaller than Windows, it's definitely time to take Mac security more seriously.<br></br>This Analytic Story addresses the ColdRoot remote access trojan (RAT), which was uploaded to Github in 2016, but was still escaping detection by the first quarter of 2018, when a new, more feature-rich variant was discovered masquerading as an Apple audio driver. Among other capabilities, the Pascal-based ColdRoot can heist passwords from users' keychains and remotely control infected machines without detection. In the initial report of his findings, Patrick Wardle, Chief Research Officer for Digita Security, explained that the new ColdRoot RAT could start and kill processes on the breached system, spawn new remote-desktop sessions, take screen captures and assemble them into a live stream of the victim's desktop, and more.<br></br>Searches in this Analytic Story leverage the capabilities of OSquery to address ColdRoot detection from several different angles, such as looking for the existence of associated files and processes, and monitoring for signs of an installed keylogger.",

            "narrative": "The first version of the SamSam ransomware (a.k.a. Samas or SamsamCrypt) was launched in 2015 by a group of Iranian threat actors. The malicious software has affected and continues to affect thousands of victims and has raised almost $6M in ransom.<br></br>Although categorized under the heading of ransomware, SamSam campaigns have some importance distinguishing characteristics. Most notable is the fact that conventional ransomware is a numbers game. Perpetrators use a \"spray-and-pray\" approach with phishing campaigns or other mechanisms, charging a small ransom (typically under $1,000). The goal is to find a large number of victims willing to pay these mini-ransoms, adding up to a lucrative payday. They use relatively simple methods for infecting systems.<br></br>SamSam attacks are different beasts. They have become progressively more targeted and skillful than typical ransomware attacks. First, malicious actors break into a victim's network, surveil it, then run the malware manually. The attacks are tailored to cause maximum damage and the threat actors usually demand amounts in the tens of thousands of dollars.<br></br>In a typical attack on one large healthcare organization in 2018, the company ended up paying a ransom of four Bitcoins, then worth $56,707. Reports showed that access to the company's files was restored within two hours of paying the sum.<br></br>According to Sophos, SamSam previously leveraged  RDP to gain access to targeted networks via brute force. SamSam is not spread automatically, like other malware. It requires skill because it forces the attacker to adapt their tactics to the individual environment. Next, the actors escalate their privileges to admin level. They scan the networks for worthy targets, using conventional tools, such as PsExec or PaExec, to deploy/execute, quickly encrypting files.<br></br>This Analytic Story includes searches designed to help detect and investigate signs of the SamSam ransomware, such as the creation of fileswrites to system32, writes with tell-tale extensions, batch files written to system32, and evidence of brute-force attacks via RDP.",

Its complexity was designed into the process to ensure that the number of blocks mined each day would remain steady. So, it's par for the course that ambitious, but unscrupulous, miners make amassing the computing power of large enterprises--a practice known as cryptojacking--a top priority. <br></br>Cryptojacking has attracted an increasing amount of media attention since its explosion in popularity in the fall of 2017. The attacks have moved from in-browser exploits and mobile phones to enterprise cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's difficult to determine exactly how widespread the practice has become, since bad actors continually evolve their ability to escape detection, including employing unlisted endpoints, moderating their CPU usage, and hiding the mining pool's IP address behind a free CDN. <br></br>When malicious miners appropriate a cloud instance, often spinning up hundreds of new instances, the costs can become astronomical for the account holder. So, it is critically important to monitor your systems for suspicious activities that could indicate that your network has been infiltrated. <br></br>This Analytic Story is focused on detecting suspicious new instances in your EC2 environment to help prevent such a disaster. It contains detection searches that will detect when a previously unused instance type or AMI is used. It also contains support searches to build lookup files to ensure proper execution of the detection searches.",

However if DNS is misconfigured, servers can be abused by attackers to levy amplification or redirection attacks against victims. Because DNS responses to <code>ANY</code> queries are so much larger than the queries themselves--and can be made with a UDP packet, which does not require a handshake--attackers can spoof the source address of the packet and cause much more data to be sent to the victim than if they sent the traffic themselves. The <code>ANY</code> requests are will be larger than normal DNS server requests, due to the fact that the server provides significant details, such as MX records and associated IP addresses. A large volume of this traffic can result in a DOS on the victim's machine. This misconfiguration leads to two possible victims, the first being the DNS servers participating in an attack and the other being the hosts that are the targets of the DOS attack.<br></br>The search in this story can help you to detect if attackers are abusing your company's DNS infrastructure to launch DNS amplification attacks causing Denial of Service to other victims.",

This often involves modifying the configuration of security tools to get around them or explicitly disabling them to prevent them from running. This Analytic Story includes searches that look for activity consistent with attackers attempting to disable various security mechanisms. Such activity may involve monitoring for suspicious registry activity, as this is where much of the configuration for Windows and various other programs reside, or explicitly attempting to shut down security-related services. Other times, attackers attempt various tricks to prevent specific programs from running, such as adding the certificates with which the security tools are signed to a blacklist (which would prevent them from running).",

These regulations also specify that a mechanism exist to notify when critical systems stop forwarding event data. For example, tracking of \u201cinitialization, stopping, or pausing of audit logs\u201d. This is directly related to the fact that commonly, the intent behind disruption to event data forwarding is malicious, e.g. an attempt to evade a preventive measure or to avoid detection. </p><h4>Impact:</h4><p>The GDPR requires that organizations collect the full audit trail of data processing activities of involved systems and applications. This can impact the organization via a wide array of GDPR articles. If breached, Article 33 requires organizations to inform the authorities, including details about the nature of the breach, such as how many individuals have been affected. The same requirement is in Article 34 for when organizations must identify which individuals are affected, in order to notify them if there is a high risk related to their individual data. If organizations do not store the requisite logs and are therefore not able to proper scope the impact, data privacy officers will need to assume the worst case scenario: all personal data that was stored or processed in the breached environment or accessible by the breached user was affected. In addition, Article 32 requires implementation of proper security controls, and for organizations to monitor, test, and demonstrate their effectiveness. If an organization experiences that logging stops for a particular host or set of hosts, then the organization will not be able to prove the status and effectiveness of the applied security controls on those systems, in the event of damage claims (Article 82) or privacy audits (Article 58). If the organization lacks host logs and corresponding application logs, they will not be able to prove which records have been processed, such as proving that a record was deleted according to an individual's delete request (Article 17) or proving compliance with a processing restriction requested by an individual (Article 18 and Article 21). If a host does not report event data, a processor cannot prove that only authorized individuals have accessed the data (Article 28).</p><h4>Resolution Path:</h4><p>Identify all GDPR-relevant IT assets from the data mapping exercise conducted by the Data Privacy Officer\u2019s team -- that is, all IT assets that are relevant to the full audit trail of data processing activities. This includes not only data stores and repositories that house sensitive PD / PII, but also any technologies that are involved in the processing, storage, transmission, receipt, rendering, encrypt/decrypt, relaying, and any other function that involves handling that data in any capacity. Ensure that those assets are configured properly to report logging activity to an appropriate central repository.

Maintaining such an audit trail is an industry best practice and can be considered an effective security control, as required by Article 32. This is applicable to processing personal data from the controller, and needs to also be addressed if contractors or sub-processors from third countries or international organizations access and transfer personal data (Article 15). In the event that a Supervisory Authority executes powers to place an organization within the scope of a privacy audit, the organization must demonstrate compliance (Article 58) \u2013 in such a scenario, it is critical to be able to show evidence of the actual scope of impact from any successful attempt(s) to access or handle personal data. If the organization faces a personal data breach and individuals are impacted, those individuals have the right to demand compensation for material and non-material damage caused by the breach. The organization must prove that they have understood and addressed the risk appropriately and deployed proper countermeasures (Article 82). Capability to demonstrate that best practice was adhered to \u2013 that is, that an audit trail was recorded of any given user\u2019s login activity to an in-scope application, and whether they viewed personal data \u2013 can help mitigate potential impact to the organization.</p>",

Ensuring that only encrypted connections are being used to access those assets is an industry best practice and can be considered an effective security control, as required by Article 32. This is applicable to processing personal data from the controller, and needs to also be addressed if contractors or sub-processors from third countries or international organizations access and transfer personal data (Article 15). In the event that a Supervisory Authority executes powers to place an organization within the scope of a privacy audit, the organization must demonstrate compliance (Article 58). If the organization faces a personal data breach and individuals are impacted, those individuals have the right to demand compensation for material and non-material damage caused by the breach. The organization must prove that they have understood and addressed the risk appropriately and deployed proper countermeasures (Article 82). Capability to demonstrate that best practice was adhered to \u2013 that is, that only encrypted connections were used for accessing personal data -- can help mitigate potential impact to the organization.</p>",

The second is to leverage just the numerical risk scores defined in the Risk Framework to show users who have bursty recent risk scores or consistent long term risk.

The second piece is harder -- in order to find project code names being searched in your logs, you have to know what those code names are (and for this detection, what department they belong to).

Then we set threshold values to deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples using eval statements. The \"deviation_threshold\" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The \"minimum_data_samples\" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.  We then check for byte transfers that are statistically significantly higher than normal. The search then gives IP address of the host, the time of the increased byte transfer, how much data was transferred, and the average amount of data transfer the email server normally sends to all hosts and to this specific host. Finally, it includes the number of standard deviations away the byte count was from these averages.",

In this search, we calculate the sum of bytes sent and bytes_out from systems categorized as email_server to each host. We then calculate the average and standard deviation for the bytes sent to all the hosts combined and on a per-host basis. Then we set threshold values to deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples using eval statements. The \"deviation_threshold\" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The \"minimum_data_samples\" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.  We then check for byte transfers that are statistically significantly higher than normal. The search then gives IP address of the host, the time of the increased byte transfer, how much data was transferred, and the average amount of data transfer the email server normally sends to all hosts and to this specific host.

            "gdprtext": "<h4>Problem:</h4><p>Many compliance and regulatory frameworks contain clauses specifying requirements for central logging of event data, as well as retention periods and use of that data to assist in detecting data breaches and investigation and handling of threats. These regulations also specify that a mechanism exist to notify when critical systems stop forwarding event data. For example, tracking of \u201cinitialization, stopping, or pausing of audit logs\u201d. This is directly related to the fact that commonly, the intent behind disruption to event data forwarding is malicious, e.g. an attempt to evade a preventive measure or to avoid detection. </p><h4>Impact:</h4><p>The GDPR requires that organizations collect the full audit trail of data processing activities of involved systems and applications. This can impact the organization via a wide array of GDPR articles. If breached, Article 33 requires organizations to inform the authorities, including details about the nature of the breach, such as how many individuals have been affected. The same requirement is in Article 34 for when organizations must identify which individuals are affected, in order to notify them if there is a high risk related to their individual data. If organizations do not store the requisite logs and are therefore not able to proper scope the impact, data privacy officers will need to assume the worst case scenario: all personal data that was stored or processed in the breached environment or accessible by the breached user was affected. In addition, Article 32 requires implementation of proper security controls, and for organizations to monitor, test, and demonstrate their effectiveness. If an organization experiences that logging stops for a particular host or set of hosts, then the organization will not be able to prove the status and effectiveness of the applied security controls on those systems, in the event of damage claims (Article 82) or privacy audits (Article 58). If the organization lacks host logs and corresponding application logs, they will not be able to prove which records have been processed, such as proving that a record was deleted according to an individual's delete request (Article 17) or proving compliance with a processing restriction requested by an individual (Article 18 and Article 21). If a host does not report event data, a processor cannot prove that only authorized individuals have accessed the data (Article 28).</p><h4>Resolution Path:</h4><p>Identify all GDPR-relevant IT assets from the data mapping exercise conducted by the Data Privacy Officer\u2019s team -- that is, all IT assets that are relevant to the full audit trail of data processing activities. This includes not only data stores and repositories that house sensitive PD / PII, but also any technologies that are involved in the processing, storage, transmission, receipt, rendering, encrypt/decrypt, relaying, and any other function that involves handling that data in any capacity. Ensure that those assets are configured properly to report logging activity to an appropriate central repository. Monitor for changes in logging status, adjust for known outages, and prioritize incident response for any failures to report by hosts that are not scheduled for downtime.</p>",

For any environments/systems that are involved in processing personal data, this situation can be critical, and especially so in a GDPR context. Article 32 of the GDPR requires that organizations regularly test, assess and evaluate effectiveness of implemented technical and organizational security controls. In the event that a Supervisory Authority executes powers to place an organization within the scope of a privacy audit, the organization must demonstrate compliance (Article 58). If the organization faces a personal data breach and individuals are impacted, those individuals have the right to demand compensation for material and non-material damage caused by the breach. The organization must prove that they have understood and addressed the risk appropriately and deployed proper countermeasures (Article 82). </p><h4>Resolution Path:</h4><p> Removing malware infections that antivirus and other legacy endpoint protection software cannot remove (whether due to file permissions or other configurations that prevents easy quarantine or cleaning) can be considered in many cases appropriate, and helps to demonstrate compliance.</p>",

In the event that a Supervisory Authority executes powers to place an organization within the scope of a privacy audit, the organization must demonstrate compliance (Article 58). If the organization faces a personal data breach and individuals are impacted, those individuals have the right to demand compensation for material and non-material damage caused by the breach. The organization must prove that they have understood and addressed the risk appropriately and deployed proper countermeasures (Article 82). </p><h4>Resolution Path:</h4><p>Removing malware infections that antivirus and other legacy endpoint protection software cannot remove (whether due to file permissions or other configurations that prevents easy quarantine or cleaning) can be considered in many cases appropriate, and helps to demonstrate compliance.</p>",

Finally, it's often realistic to make some determination of risk based on the file names copied, though it's important to not be overly reliant on that indication (if I were to exfiltrate data, I would likely create a zip file called expense_report_receipts.zip or something mundane).</p><p>Ultimately, with many behavioral detections, you probably don't want to evaluate this alert in a vacuum, as you would end up with an excessive number of false positives.

Ultimately we are trying to infer that a user is exercising day trading from their proxy logs with categorization, which is very tricky. Really what this detection looks for is \"sustained heavy access to websites that are associated with stock trading.\" In most organizations, many users will periodically trade stocks. Some users may even leave a stock website up all day (or leverage widgets that track stock access). The goal is to set the bar high enough that anyone who triggers this particular rule is spending lots of time trading, with traffic to a number of different sites.</p><p>To build the rule, we looked at an organization that did not have any known day trading behavior -- we looked for users who had large amount of trading-related activities, and looked at what a heavy versus light hour was, to try to determine what it would look like when a user was focused on this. However, because we don't have a few bad users to make sure we would detect the right or wrong things, we can't say with confidence that we have exactly the right patterns. That said, this should be a good foundation. If you have the opportunity to tune this in your organization and can offer some real-world experiences, please provide feedback!</p><p>There are three thresholds in this particular search.<ol><li>In the first, we look for connections that last longer than 60 seconds. Most web servers that expect return traffic will keep connections open for prolonged periods of time to improve performance and reduce utilization on their load balancers. In testing, this seems to filter out some advertising.</li><li>For the second filter, we look in a single hour for where there are at least 30 different connections. Thirty different connections lasting longer than a minute indicates a very heavy amount of activity in that hour.</li><li>Finally we count how many hours have that amount of activity over the last week (specifically, looking for at least 20 hours of heavy activity).</li></ol></p><p>Again, we would love to get feedback on the viability of this rule based on real-world experience.</p>",

            "howToImplement": "<p>There are multiple approaches for pulling lists of Privileged Users, and multiple definitions of what privileged really means for a given scenario.</p><p><b>Pulling Users</b>. In this example we show three different methods for pulling lists of users: querying LDAP, querying a database, or looking for users who take the actions that a privileged user would take. Let's walk through these examples. <ul><li>Pulling from LDAP - there are three different approaches for pulling from LDAP. We generally recommend that most users start by using the Supporting Add-on for Active Directory (aka SA-ldapsearch) which provides the ldapsearch command. This command is native in Splunk, and works great for on premises installations in organizations with fewer than 50,000 users (<a href=\"https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1151/\" target=\"_blank\">app link</a>, <a href=\"http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SA-LdapSearch/2.1.6/User/AbouttheSplunkSupportingAdd-onforActiveDirectory\" target=\"_blank\">docs link</a>). You can also pull data using AD Monitor, which is the Splunk Universal Forwarder's ability to monitor Active Directory for changes -- recommended for large organizations, and for Cloud environments (<a href=\"http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.2/Data/MonitorActiveDirectory\" target=\"_blank\">doc link</a>). Finally, it is sometimes simpler to use Powershell for this effort (<a href=\"https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Powershell-script-to-5edcdaea\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>).</li><li>Organizations with formal systems for managing privileged users that don't sync to Active Directory will most frequently need to pull a list of users by querying a database (though sometimes an API is available). This frequently occurs when you have an on-prem software application backed by a database that stores a list of privileged users. The process you will walk through to pull that data into Splunk is to first discover the username and password to log into the database along with the query that will return your desired set of users, and then configure Splunk DB Connect (<a href=\"https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2686/\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>, <a href=\"http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/DBX/latest\">doc link</a>) to pull that data. Learning the credentials and the required query is sometimes very easy, and sometimes very difficult, but often you will be able to find help from Splunk Professional Services or on <a href=\"https://answers.splunk.com/\">Splunk Answers</a>.</li><li>Finally, we can always infer a list of privileged users by finding users who take privileged actions. There are many ways to approach this process, but the simplest is by searching for the use of tag=privileged  on authentication events, as defined by the Splunk Common Information Model.</li></ul></p><p>Now we've discussed how to ingest the data in the first place -- but we haven't discussed what data we actually should be ingesting. There are two primary categories of privileged users that we might want to monitor: those who have administrative rights, and those that are privileged. <ul><li>Those who have administrative rights is a very simple question to answer in a smaller organization, but exponentially more difficult with the complexity of the environment. It's best to start with standard privileged AD groups, such as Domain Admins, and then expand into environment-specific groups, such as the custom help desk admin group that had local admin rights on all workstations (every company has at least one of these). It's often easiest to find these types of groups by hunting through LDAP for key terms such as \"*admin*\" or \"*operator*\" etc. Finally, wrap up by searching for users with specific admin rights, such as privileged service accounts and see what groups (if any) they belong to. It's generally advisable to look for known administrative users across the organization (either specific names, or by naming scheme such as jsmith-a) and seeing which groups these users belong to.</li><li>Generally speaking, understanding VIP users in an organization can be dramatically easier than finding all admin accounts. Title will frequently get you all you need, though you may also find that tracking the # of steps away from the CEO based on reporting structure can be very effective. It's important to not forget employees that are associated with highly visible people but aren't themselves as visible, particularly the executive assistants for all your important users. They generally have full access to an exec's calendar, mailboxes, and more often than we would like they will also have a text file somewhere on their computer with the executive's password (or similar).</li></ul></p>",

Salesforce is an example of a CRM business application which is used to store and process personal data relating to customers, partners, prospects and often employees. As part of a Salesforce.com deployment, other applications interact with this sensitive data, via push or pull APIs that automate data exchange - for example integrations into finance and human resources applications such as Workday, or marketing automation tools such as Eloqua and Marketo. Attackers can attempt to use the Salesforce.com API as a vector to gain access to sensitive data. Because Salesforce.com is a cloud application with a publicly accessible domain, this vector only requires valid credentials, and can be exploited for access to sensitive data by adversaries, even if they lack access to internal resources.</p><h4>Impact:</h4><p>Under the GDPR Article 30, organizations are required to maintain a record of processing activities including contact details of the controller, the purposes of processing, description of the categories of data subjects and personal data processed -- as well as the categories of recipients to whom the personal data has been or will be disclosed including recipients in any other countries. Interactions from new applications -- whether for legitimate purposes or as a result of malicious activity -- can create a non-compliance condition if they are not documented properly. This situation may not impact organizations who employ fewer than 250 persons and therefore may not have critical categories of personal data for processing.</p><h4>Resolution Path:</h4><p>Monitoring Salesforce.com API activity can help identify connections from new applications or clients that might not be whitelisted or documented. The timely and accurate reporting of a non-compliance state can prompt the Data Privacy Officer to proactively follow up and update documentation, and report to the authorities in a timely manner if appropriate.</p>",

It's also one of the searches in SSE where the live version is way simpler than the demo version, because we can take advantage of simple keyword searching.</p><p>There are three phases to this search. <ul><li>First we run a subsearch to collect a list of filenames from a CSV file (also called a lookup) that contains a list of tools that are labeled as discovery, attacker, suspicious. If you've never used a subsearch before, the basic idea is that you take a search that works on its own, usually one that returns just one column. When you put brackets around that and add it into a new search, Splunk will run the subsearch first, take those columns and add them to the main search. For example, if your subsearch had a single field called \"name\" with a value \"David\", name=\"David\" would be added into your main search. If it returned two rows, and the second row had \"name\" with the value \"John\", then the main search would use (name=\"David\" OR name=\"John\"). They're pretty simple once you get used to them. For more info, check out the <a href=\"https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.1/SearchTutorial/Useasubsearch\">docs</a>, or explore <a href=\"https://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAPX9\">Free Splunk Training</a>.</li>\n<li>Next we search in our process launch logs for any of those filenames. This is straightforward Splunk searching.</li><li>Finally, the other fancy part of this search is using the transaction command. Transaction takes all the logs in and groups them together by whatever field you specify, in this case host. So functionally, we are grouping together all the process launches for attacker tools (since we already filtered for them) per host. Transaction can be slow with really big datasets, but it works great for relatively small datasets like this. It also has tons of knobs and levers -- check out the <a href=\"http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/SearchReference/transaction\">docs</a> for more. </li></ul>",

            "howToImplement": "<p>There are two primary triggers for this search -- one is the categories being excluded, and the other is the number of denies that you want to trigger on. There is no standard best practice for either of these, so you can adjust these values to be whatever makes sense for your organization. The most common way we hear of this detection being described is to target suspicious internal users, so most organizations will adjust the filters to look for Acceptable Use Policy violations (e.g., browsing gambling sites) as opposed to denies that are tied to security hygiene (e.g., phishing). That said, you could absolutely implement it in both directions if you so desired. The threshold for triggering would likely be different between those categories though, as a human will likely quit relatively early when they see deny messages versus a script that gets timeouts instead of a big error message.</p><p><b>If this searches creates too many false positives in your environment</b>, it may be because some of your users just generate a very large number of proxy denies on a regular basis. The first bet for dealing with this would be basic tuning of the categories you alert on. If that is not sufficient, you can instead implement this as a per-user time series detection. Look for the # of unauthorized detections per day per user, and then alert when any user exceeds their baseline. You can base this on any of the time series detections in Splunk Security Essentials -- a common and easy one would be to look at <a href=\"/app/Splunk_Security_Essentials/showcase_standard_deviation?ml_toolkit.dataset=Increase in Interactive Logons - Demo\" target=\"_blank\">Increase in Interactive Logons</a> (just swap out the field names and base dataset and implementation will be easy). There's one important adjustment you would need in order to make that work for you though -- because most users don't see proxy denies often, most of your users will end up with very low averages and low standard deviations. To guard against this, in addition to tracking that the most recent # of denies per day is more than 3 (or 6, or whatever) stdev above the average, you should also make sure that the most recent # is more than 5 (or 10, or whatever). That way you don't accidentally alert on a user that just had one deny (no matter how anomalous a deny is for that user).</p>",
