In addition, threat intelligence providers often deliver very little, if any, context or attribution around their Intel. This makes it difficult for an analyst to determine if a match against a given feed is associated with a commodity or APT-based threat. The inability to make this distinction alone can have serious implications to a company. This discussion will focus on the role Threat Intelligence plays in an active breach investigation and how the new Threat Intelligence Framework in Splunk App for Enterprise Security can be used to fulfill this role.

Search Head Clustering solves this by providing highly available search heads. Administrators can group a set of machines into search head clusters and add and remove nodes dynamically as and when their requirements change. The search heads are behind sticky load balancers which distribute the user sessions across the search head cluster members. The scheduled searches and alerts are automatically load balanced across the cluster. Configuration changes done on one search head are replicated across the members, giving an identical look and feel.

By combining text mining techniques and machine learning, we can use Splunk and R together to interpret and classify logs, even if Splunk has never seen them before. Text mining techniques turn words and sentences into easily digested numeric matrices with which algorithms can train! We are currently using this technique on multiple log sources, such as vCenter, syslog, Cisco UCS and Splunkd.logs, among multiple customers - combining this mechanism with Splunk's built-in alerting WebHook to automate ticket creation.

Therefore, the naive or overly enthusiastic user is only one click away from querying all data since the dawn of time.

2017,Splunk Machine Learning Capabilities and Condition-Based Maintenance: Train Doors on the German Public Rail Transport System,"Henning Brandt, Data Analyst, ESE GmbH; Daniel Pal, Data Analyst, ESE GmbH","In Europe, especially in Germany, trains are among the leading means of public transportation. Security-relevant subassemblies of passenger train features, such as entry doors, are always given the highest priority - which leads to costly maintenance. In an attempt to reduce these costs, two trains have been equipped with Multifunction Vehicle Bus (MVB) units in a proof of concept to track door control actions in real-time. The MVB unit monitors the power consumption of an open/close door event and divides it into 256 measuring points. The main goal of our project is to replace the static maintenance cycle of targeted subassemblies with an optimized and condition-based maintenance system. To achieve this, we set up a Splunk dashboard, which brings together machine data, geo data and weather data by using machine learning algorithms like DBSCAN. We are able to detect anomalies like increased power consumption and event length to predict failing parts.",Splunk Enterprise,"IoT & Industrial Data, Business Analytics","Technology, Travel & Transportation",Customer Success Story,IoT & Industrial Data,Theater,Good for all skill levels,Internet of Things,"Splunk Technical Champion, CISO, CIO, CTO, Developer, Operations Manager, Administrator, Architect, Business Manager, Site Reliability/Systems Engineer, Data Scientist/Analyst, Security Analyst",conf.splunk.com/files/2017/recordings/splunk-machine-learning-capabilities-and-conditionbased-maintenance-train-doors-on-the-german-public-rail-transport-system.mp4,conf.splunk.com/files/2017/slides/splunk-machine-learning-capabilities-and-conditionbased-maintenance-train-doors-on-the-german-public-rail-transport-system.pdf

(Splunk@Murex For Test and Development)","Robert Lynch, Splunk Global Manager and Performance Manager, Murex","Performance analysis on financial software is massively complex and challenging. This is the story of how Murex, a world leader in trading platforms used by financial institutions, started to use the Splunk platform to help debug performance problems. Before deploying the Splunk platform, we had millions and millions of timings logs, and a problem displaying them quickly so they were usable for developers and testers. Up to this point, we were using a basic PDF report with graphs with static mathematics. However, when we were able to dynamically graph this data with Splunk the analysis became much quicker and easier. The turnaround time decreased for resolution, testing and development. In addition, we developed multiple functions in the dashboard to enhance the usability. A developer could attach their environment to the Splunk platform in 5 seconds for live monitoring and save a test as a URL to share with their colleagues. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJsTp7XlGGA [Dashboard for Developers/Testers]",Splunk Enterprise,"IT Operations, Application Delivery",Financial Services,,DevOps,Breakout Session,Good for all skill levels,IT Operations,"Splunk Technical Champion, Data Scientist/Analyst, Developer",conf.splunk.com/files/2017/recordings/if-you-graph-it-they-will-see-it-identifying-root-issues-from-product-testing-to-production-crisis-splunk-at-murex-for-test-and-development.mp4,conf.splunk.com/files/2017/slides/if-you-graph-it-they-will-see-it-identifying-root-issues-from-product-testing-to-production-crisis-splunkmurex-for-test-and-development.pdf

This session demonstrates leveraging DevOps principles and AWS cloud products to reduce your cluster's storage needs while still meeting your users' data requirements. Responding to and unifying all stakeholder needs and concerns is key to effective DevOps; this session provides a framework and techniques for bringing such unity to Splunk. We'll start by using Amazon SQS to ingest logs stored in S3, and we'll show you how to best make use of its ability to ingest (or reingest) logs on demand. Next, we'll use summary indexing to pick and choose data you want to retain forever at insignificant cost. This is especially useful for systems like Puppet, Jenkins, Nginx and Apache. They produce high volumes of events that are essential to DevOps teams when newly ingested but, as the data ages, its overall trends and summaries provide all the value. If you do need access to specific older data from these sources, you can use SQS to reingest it for analysis. In the second part of this talk, we'll focus on measuring the business value of each gigabyte you've indexed by source type and by retention window. These strategies help DevOps teams track and justify their joint decisions. By maximizing your data's overall utility, you can better support users who make large demands on your Splunk cluster's resources.

Events were initially created to help humans find what was broken. But the complexity and sheer volume of this time-series data has outstripped our ability to simply ""manage events."" In today's IT environments, identifying and quieting the noise to find root cause events is often futile and inconsequential. The path to providing the prioritized, actionable, human-scale intelligence that enables IT to find what is broken is actually in the event data itself - all of the data, not a filtered, aggregated subset of data!

2017,Splunk UBA: Setting Active Directory's Security Straight,"Stanislav Miskovic, Principal Data Scientist, Splunk","Active Directory (AD) is a service of choice for user and device management in corporate environments. The service provides rich telemetry, making security analysts believe that choosing few representative AD events can ensure attack detection. This is not the case: we show that events miss crucial information, they are too granular to capture modern threats and they may be randomly reported. Consequently, exploits get undetected, incidents overrepresented and attacks spuriously attributed, all leading to misguided SOC operation. In this talk, we propose a new approach to AD security analysis that is accurate and automated.

2017,Taking Care of Patients With Splunk,"Theodore Hellmann, Product Manager, Splunk; Sergii Kononov, Senior Delivery Manager, EPAM Systems; Igal Vainer, Senior Director of Isv Unit, EPAM Systems","Patients are usually unaware of the nature and composition of their care team. Clinical staff struggle to quickly identify other appropriate and available staff members in an emergency or if they have questions. Hospital executives lack a comprehensive view of patient-staff interactions and resource utilization within the hospital. Compliance departments do not have a real-time view of whether a staff member's patient record access is relevant to their job. These factors are driving the need to identify the patient's circle of care. Enabling effective communications in the circle of care may provide additional opportunities to improve care processes and patient satisfaction. Relevant data is scattered across multiple systems. EPAM's Splunk-based solution integrates information from multiple data sources and identifies care-circle participants. The solution adds further value by providing insights into the nature of the care circle, its participants and relevant care activities. Additional operational KPIs represent a good opportunity for management teams to optimize care processes.","Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud",Business Analytics,Healthcare,Dev Tools,DevOps,Breakout Session,Intermediate,Developer,Developer,conf.splunk.com/files/2017/recordings/taking-care-of-patients-with-splunk.mp4,conf.splunk.com/files/2017/slides/taking-care-of-patients-with-splunk.pdf

2017,"Virtual Reality Process Visualization at OTTO, aka -Geheimprojekt URSULA-","Andre Pietsch, Produktmanager, OTTO GmbH & Co. KG","t OTTO, with -Geheimprojekt URSULA- we explored virtual reality as the next big thing in data visualization for Splunk. We created a basic platform that can visualize a graph model with nodes and edges in VR and imported our existing process graphs. That gave us an idea about the complexity of the processes. Then we connected the platform to a Splunk instance via REST API and mapped machine data to the nodes. As a result we were able to monitor and manage a complex process with a simple interface. To accomplish all that, we partnered with Dell EMC and Gemini Data. We finally drafted a product with the help of LC Systems that can be developed into a turnkey solution. In this presentation we will tell you about the components needed and how to stich them together. We will also show a demo and discuss what could be done with a VR platform.",Splunk Enterprise,Business Analytics,"Retail, Online Services","Customer Success Story, Platform Extensibility, Visualizations, Using Splunk",Business Analytics,Breakout Session,Intermediate,Business Analytics,Business Manager,conf.splunk.com/files/2017/recordings/virtual-reality-process-visualization-at-otto-aka-geheimprojekt-ursula.mp4,conf.splunk.com/files/2017/slides/virtual-reality-process-visualization-at-otto-aka-geheimprojekt-ursula.pdf

Our international healthcare business kept moving forward, demanding capabilities we couldn't deliver: to perform granular endpoint data analysis, prevent recurring insider threat where our IP was being stolen, and of course to provide full surveillance into our new Office 365 environment. To lean forward, we are now leveraging a massive Kafka infrastructure and the newly released, open sourced Splunk Connect for Kafka, along with HEC. Thanks to this technology selection, we are able to globally scale to meet the needs of the business, ensuring an ease of data onboarding, high reliability and redundancy of our critical security data.

2018,SECS2225 - Achieving synchrony across the enterprise security organization through passive collaboration.,"Chris Jacob, VP, Threat Intelligence Engineering, ThreatQuotient","While at a high level, analysts and industry pundits speak to tearing down the silos between teams in order to achieve better results. In practice, this approach breaks down when faced with the volume and velocity of threat data typical in most security organizations. Practitioners become focused on the daily tasks of their jobs, and sharing results with the other teams takes a back seat or is not happening at all. If information is shared, it's often not in a form that can be easily consumable by the receiving team. Security Operations Centers (SOCs) live in SIEM tools, capable of handling large amounts of data. Enforcement and inspections tools however have a finite amount of memory available and require a much more curated data set to be able to operate effectively. In this presentation, we will discuss the implementation of machine to machine collaboration, and the establishment of an ""Intelligence Funnel"" to move the large data sets of a SOC, to the more targeted data sets of the incident response team, and finally to the extremely contextual data sets of the enforcement infrastructure.",,,Not industry specific,,,Breakout Session,Good for all skill levels,"Security, Compliance and Fraud",,,

2018,"IoT2071 - An Enterprise View of Building Intelligence, IoT, and IT","Christopher Perez, Enterprise Technology Solutions - Advisor, PSE","The need to embrace an enterprise view of building intelligence is critical. Complicated support models, single source vendor support, and lack of standard IT hardening practices are just a few of the risks to a customer when systems are furnished without the involvement of IT. The success of modern enterprise IT organizations has gone beyond the data center and the desktop, and is involved in building climate and environment, collaboration technologies and the mission critical systems that keep a building in operation. To make business intelligence successful, mature IT organizations must be involved in all aspects of a modern construction build from utility to virtual space, and leverage sensor data found in IoT devices to gain visibility and create a holistic view of the user/employee experience. The Internet of Things (IoT) and Splunk Dashboards monitor the overall health of a building and enable businesses to make data-driven decisions on investment of technologies and the entire user experience. The ability to see the impact of a seemingly unrelated event drives down overall response and triage times for those events. Enterprise NOCs can leverage a universal skillset and dashboard instead of trying to maintain visibility and knowledge of the myriad of expert systems often found in enterprises.

When an adversary interacts with deception, the platform raises an alert containing information about the adversary (e.g., source IP address, OS, services, username, file activity, registry activity, packet capture, etc.). We correlate the deception alert data with other data sources in Splunk to profile threats and generate internal threat intelligence. In this session, we will provide an introduction to deception and share details about triaging deception alerts with other alerts in Splunk to profile hidden threats.","Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security",,Not industry specific,,,Theater,Intermediate,"Security, Compliance and Fraud","Data Scientist/Analyst, Security Analyst",conf.splunk.com/files/2018/recordings/detecting-and-profiling-hidden-sec1474.mp4,static.rainfocus.com/splunk/splunkconf18/sess/1523454338549001h4mx/finalPDF/SEC1474_DetectingAndProfilingHidden_Final_1538509041144001V2na.pdf

We will show how to leverage the data for IP history, correlate the data with traditional asset management sources and integrate it with Splunk Enterprise Security. We will then move onto using discovery techniques to correlate multiple sources of records in Splunk. A predictive based approach will demonstrate subnet discovery. Finally, reverse attribution techniques will show historic attribution of identities against data sources over time and custom Splunk ES attribution swim lanes will be presented.","Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud, Splunk Enterprise Security",,Not industry specific,,,Breakout Session,Intermediate,"Security, Compliance and Fraud",,conf.splunk.com/files/2018/recordings/find-and-seek-real-time-sec1624.mp4,static.rainfocus.com/splunk/splunkconf18/sess/1523503933784001sLOT/finalPDF/SEC1624_FindAndSeekReal_Final_15385955090140012jBD.pdf

2018,SECS2100 - From Endpoint to Firewall - Building Effective Threat Perimeters with Cisco and Splunk,"Alejo Calaoagan, Cisco Systems; Douglas Hurd, Cisco Systems","Perimeter security has evolved. An effective perimeter is no longer just access control at the firewall. Users and their traffic move on and off the enterprise network leaving wide gaps in visibility and threat detection. Firewalls are still key to the perimeter, but endpoints and visibility to off-network traffic, such as SaaS applications, has become key to deploying effective perimeter security. The good news is you probably already have the telemetry needed to build an effective threat perimeter -- you're just not using it. In this session we will discuss where to use Splunk analytics with Cisco Security to: 
1) Turn your access control perimeter into a threat control perimeter by increasing threat insight gathered from your Cisco firewalls; 
2) analyze user and endpoint traffic behavior on and off-network, including SaaS applications, with Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client; and 
3) identify malicious Internet destinations and stop users from accessing them with Cisco Umbrella.",Splunk Enterprise,,Not industry specific,,,Breakout Session,Good for all skill levels,"Security, Compliance and Fraud",,conf.splunk.com/files/2018/recordings/from-endpoint-to-firewall-secs2100.mp4,static.rainfocus.com/splunk/splunkconf18/sess/1534806486078001bMNX/finalPDF/From-Endpoint-to-Firewall-2100_1538861000315001Yo26.pdf

1) missing data from production environments or machines for efficiency analytics and industrial security 
2) a newer touch running system mindset and 
3) a non-calculable ROI for security investments. 
We show real world projects from Volkswagen where we overcame these blockers. In the presented projects, industrial security is rolled out in a piggybacking mode together with production data acquisition, analytics and predictive maintenance. This creates win-win-situations for all relevant stakeholders in production -- including those in operations, maintenance and IT security.

SOC's daily routine employs many assumptions -- believing that a server we personally deployed is still a database server, or that Alice is just a developer as per IT asset repositories, or that Bob only works at the headquarter office. Reality is much more dynamic than we're comfortable admitting - users change their roles, they deploy new tools for their work, they share accounts, devices get repurposed, etc. Before we know it, SOC has only a vague understanding of the company's security posture. To address this problem, we developed state-of-the-art algorithms in Splunk's UBA to continuously discover and profile all critical security resources.

MLTK is based on Python scikit-learn and is bounded to the available resources on the search head, both memory and CPU. In many cases, search heads are shared with other searches (ad-hoc and scheduled searches). When large data sets are used or dealing with fast growing data volume, it is not easy to scale out as needed. Spark is known to have linear scalability up to a large number of nodes (in thousands). For ML jobs with large data, it can offload compute to the Spark cluster so that they won't bottleneck the search head. Also, Spark's map-reduce model may achieve better performance with parallelized algorithms, ideally more resources thrown at the problem will make the execution faster. For deployment and operation, scaling out will be a relatively easy task by adding additional Spark workers. Resources can also be allocated/decommissioned dynamically based on workload.",Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit,,Not industry specific,,,Breakout Session,Good for all skill levels,Foundations / Platform,"Data Scientist/Analyst, Security Analyst, Splunk Technical Champion",conf.splunk.com/files/2018/recordings/using-spark-and-mllib-fn1364.mp4,static.rainfocus.com/splunk/splunkconf18/sess/1523315089950001nFR9/finalPDF/Using-Spark-and-MLlib-1364_1538792259889001CncS.pdf

We have taken that a step further to share our training methodology with the community -- from universities to elementary school programs -- leveraging Splunk to create more opportunities to learn cybersecurity. Along the way, we've learned even more about how to optimize training to equip the hundreds of cybersecurity technologists and analysts that we hire each year, in addition to the large number of customers that we train at no charge. This session will introduce ways to scale your team by transferring skills from your most experienced team members to the rest of the team. We'll also explain how we reduced a 14-month training timeline to five weeks.",,,,,,Breakout Session,,,,,static.rainfocus.com/splunk/splunkconf18/sess/1536359336257001MLxg/finalPDF/What-20000-Fifth-Graders-2164_1538859124390001CMTB.pdf
2018,IT1169 - What Is Your DevOps Team Actually Doing?,"Brandon Cipes, cPrime, Inc.; Justin Evans, cPrime, Inc.","DevOps solutions are tying together increasingly complex tools and solutions that can be hard to manage and monitor. To check on the health of your processes you need to be dialed in to your source code, artifact management, continuous integration, delivery and deployment, static code analysis, security analysis, monitoring health, infrastructure and test automation, just to name a few. On top of this broadening responsibility, iterative based development practices have increased the cadence of teams and the delivery of features and capabilities. If you don't have your finger on the pulse of your organization, you could already be in trouble. Providing a dashboard to view the real-time health of your delivery and operations pipeline is as important as tracking the resultant applications themselves. Come see how to aggregate your view of the DevOps world in practice.","Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud, Splunk IT Service Intelligence",,Not industry specific,,,Breakout Session,Intermediate,IT Operations,"Administrator, Architect, Business Manager, CIO, CTO, Data Scientist/Analyst, Developer, Operations Manager, Security Analyst, Site Reliability/Systems Engineer, Splunk Technical Champion",conf.splunk.com/files/2018/recordings/what-is-your-devops-it1169.mp4,static.rainfocus.com/splunk/splunkconf18/sess/1522073660766001sPXF/finalPDF/IT1169_WhatIsYourDevOpsTeam_Final_1538854677088001YEWW.pdf

2018,SEC1833 - WMI -- The Hacker's Chocolate to Their PowerShell Peanut Butter,"Rico Valdez, Principal Security Research Engineer, Splunk","Sophisticated attackers are increasingly moving away from introducing new binaries and tools to compromised systems, as such code is often detected via common defensive and forensic tools. Defenses incorporating whitelisting techniques can also completely prevent unknown code from executing. More recent techniques involve leveraging the native tools and functionality of the operating system to achieve objectives without ""dropping code."" Such techniques can be leveraged to do almost anything, including serving as a backdoor to the system. Attacks leveraging such techniques are exceedingly difficult to identity. Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) contains all the functionality an attacker could want to carry out this type of attack, and PowerShell can be leveraged to interact with WMI to execute it. This talk focuses on how threat actors can leverage WMI in attacks, where the juicy data is to identify this behavior, and how you can detect and counter these threats using Splunk.","Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security",,Not industry specific,,,Breakout Session,Intermediate,"Security, Compliance and Fraud","Data Scientist/Analyst, Security Analyst",conf.splunk.com/files/2018/recordings/wmi-the-hackers-chocolate-sec1833.mp4,static.rainfocus.com/splunk/splunkconf18/sess/1523578675195001VubJ/finalPDF/SEC1833_WMITheHackerChocolate_Final_15385980427120012ky0.pdf

That statement certainly hits home for me. So, come learn from the mistakes of others so that you make less of your own. Some things work on a single Splunk instance, but break in a distributed environments. Some inputs work on your system, but fail on others.
