##### Installation #####

* If your Splunk Enterprise server or your client machine are connected to the Internet, you can navigate to the app browser from the launcher home page. 

1. Click "+ Find More Apps" below your last installed app to go directly to the app browser. You can also click the gear next to "Apps" to go to the apps manager page. 
2. Click the "Browse more apps" button to go to the app browser. 
3. Search for the ".conf Archive Search" app. 
4. Click on the "Install" button for the app.

* If your Splunk Enterprise server and client do not have Internet connectivity, you must download apps from Splunkbase and copy them over to your server:

1. From a computer connected to the Internet, browse Splunkbase for the ".conf Archive Search" app or go to https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3330/.
2. Download the app.
3. Once downloaded, copy it to your Splunk Enterprise server.  
4. Put it in your $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps directory.  
5. Untar and ungzip the app, using a tool like tar -xvf (on *nix) or WinZip (on Windows). Note that Splunk apps and add-ons are packaged with a .SPL extension although they are just tarred and gzipped. You may need to force your tool to recognize this extension.
6. You should not need to restart Splunk Enterprise.
7. The app should now be installed and will be available from Splunk Home.
